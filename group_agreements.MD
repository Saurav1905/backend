# Group Agreements
  1) Meet in Quiet Zoom @ 9AM for check-in / stand-up

      * Daily Temperature Check (as a human...)
          - How are you doing right now?  
          - How's the project going?
          - Whats going good?  
          - What are you having difficulty with / frustrated with?

      * What did we get done yesterday / what do we have planned for today
          - what did you work on yesterday / explain how things work/ how you made them
          - what is our goal today (what are we doing to work toward MVP)
          - check in on our project board and review things that need to be done & things that have been completed
          - what are we going to work on individually for the day / what would you like to work on / be involved in

  2) Communication / Conflict plan :)
      * We plan to have NO conflict... but if we do....
          - recognize tension in the air and have a group meeting immediately
          - talk to each other / every voice should be heard

  3) Work Flow
      * 9-6 is our work day... its ok to work on stuff after hours... just check in!
      * Breaks! --> take 'em as you need 'em... but remind each other to take them
